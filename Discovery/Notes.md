# Raw Meeting Notes

Developers and investors connection app
Handling Escrow - app would help to maintain relationship between 3 parties (investor(s), developer, founder)
Person could be both a founder and a developer, or an investor and a developer, etc.
Separate pages/tabs for the roles, not locked behind an account.

“Design template to handle the pretty stuff” - going to create mockups
Preference is .NET, database stuff he's open, SQLserver, poscres, stay away from mySQL
View, react, or angular

Website

Website → api → backend

Bitbucket, gitLab gives free private repositories

Elysium elasium
Jira - management tool
Confluence - wiki for jira

GitKraken
Gitflow - git workflow design

Slim. - for the front end

Using Scrum - watch youtube video

Summary - Jira, BitBucket, GitKraken, maybe Confluence

App to help people connect there ideas to developers and investors
Founder will post idea, then investor(s) will invest, and finally developers will contact to work on the idea
Investor money would be held by the website to ensure the founder can't run off with the money
Instead of small investments from a large amount of people, there are large investments from a small amount of people
Each account is not locked to a specific role, they can interchange between
Database selection is open, but it is recommended for SQL server
PostgreSQL a possibility??
Front-end JS whatever we are comfortable with: View, React, Angular
Web based, app not functional enough in theory
Using a back-end API to allow for easier add of operating environments
Git Kraken can be a useful tool to help manage git
Git Flow workflow recommend for easier git use
Slim is going to be used for laying out the website
Using Kickstarter as an example of ideas to use, such as the editors page

We unfortunately did not get a screenshot of the meeting.
