## Topics Discussed
In this meeting with Trey, we presented our Iteration 2 software to him and showed him our three features we were working on for this iteration. We showed our pitch page creation,
our messaging, and the search function. The meeting itself was very short because Trey was driving when we had our meeting, but he didn't have any complaints about our 
software and was happy to see our progress. We also discussed our signin system, Okta, when Trey asked about what we are using for our sign-in. 
We also went over our API with our client, showing him the general layout of our backend. 


## Things Clarified
Not very much was clarified during this meeting other than the fact that we are on track for the future iterations. we struggled in iteration 1 and didnt have anything to show to Trey,
so coming into the end of iteration 2 and having three different features was a good way to finish the semester.
