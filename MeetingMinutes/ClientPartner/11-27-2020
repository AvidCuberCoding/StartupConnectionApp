## Topics Discussed
We discussed our first iteration progress as well as where and how we went wrong. Specifically, we discussed how we over-committed this iteration which led to us having a lot of 
backend, but practically no worthwhile functionality. Instead of spreading ourselves too thin in iteration two, we're going to attempt to share the workload 
and pair program next iteration.

Another topic we discussed is where we went right this iteration. This iteration we decided that we work well as a group and communicate effectively; this is our strongest point.

Chris and Julian shared their screens to show Trey the current progress.
