## Topics Discussed

Went over design materials with our client (Trey). He said he liked our design materials, and said he could tell we put a lot of effort in. Went through ever section of our materials, and asked for feedback over each section. Trey had various ideas and tweaks to our existing materials, and we have updated our design materials accordingly. He also suggested a change in our tech stack from angular to view.

## Things Clarified

With a clear pitcure of how to begin our project after the meeting, the group agreed to continue meeting to work on our presentation for our design day meeting. We also all joined GitLab in preparation for beginning work on the project.
