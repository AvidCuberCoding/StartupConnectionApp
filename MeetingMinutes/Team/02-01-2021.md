## Topics Discussed

The team gave updates on the current status of the project and what they have completed. We had also started to do pair programming and split into breakrooms to work.
Julian and Chris worked on getting the backend working with the pitch page. While Robert and Jim worked towards getting the frontend up and running to push and receive data
from the endpoints created.
