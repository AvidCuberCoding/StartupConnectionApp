## Topics Discussed

The team gathered to talk about the end of iteration 4 and what we needed to get done before we submit our work. We put all of our focus on asthetics 
and the overall quality of the code. The team wanted to make sure that the creation pitch page and the viewable pitch page were both more asthetically pleasing.
There was also talk about allowing user submmited images as this should be a simple task to finish before we submit.

## Things Clarified

The teams main feature for this iteration is the ability to search for users and pitches within the database. When a user searches for a pitch they are able to
click the title of the pitch on the search page to be redirected to the viewable pitch page. This makes search a fully functional feature reather than being
half baked.
