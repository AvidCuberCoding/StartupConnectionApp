## Topics Discussed

This meeting was held right after the client meeting, so the team discussed the results. There was quite a bit of concern due to the team having no end user 
features completed. We started to find ways to improve upon the second iteration to assure we would do better than the first. In this meeting it was decided to commit
to pair programming more and allow the team to work together more often. For example, Julian and Chris have set up scheduling to meet and continue working on the search
functionality of the software. As we continue to move through this iteration we are committed to doing better using the action items found in our mentor meeting. 
This meeting existed to help reinforce those action items that we had commited to. We had also decided to have a document with our schedules, an action item on the list, 
that was created during this meeting.


## Things Clarified

Communication is important and the team needs to rely on this more. The more communication we have the better the team will be overall. 
We had set everything in motion to make sure that iteration two will be better than our first.
