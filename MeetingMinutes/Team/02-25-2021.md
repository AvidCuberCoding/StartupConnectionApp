## Topics Discussed

This meeting was initally meant to be set as a mentor meeting but had a last second shift to be a team meeting. We had discussed what the team will
be doing to meet the iteration goals by the deadline. This put the primary focus around getting search to functionally be able to search existing 
pitch pages. The team had also had small talk around resumes to see how we could help each other improve the format. 

## Things Clarified

That the primary goal for this iteration is to assure we get some testing done and searching by pitches complete. Anything past these two will be considered
extra work at the end of the queue.
