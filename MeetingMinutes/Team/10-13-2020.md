## Topics Discussed

This meeting consisted of tying up any loose ends we had on the domain model such as adding missing classes, getting everything linked up properly, etc. This didn't take very long since we had done the domain modeling on Sunday and we were confirming that everything was right.

After we finished domain modeling, we went into the Tech-Stack and established what we are going to use for the project. Half of our choices revolved around what Trey wanted, but the database management and Front-end were our choice, and we chose them due to personal preference. This wasn't hard to do, however we all will have to learn new languages and version control for the sake of the project, but we were all willing to learn without issue.


## Things Clarified

There wasn't much for this meeting that we needed help with, however we did establish our meeting with Trey on 10/20/2020 at 1pm to discuss our design and get any feedback from him and a meeting on 10/18 with Evan to get his input.
