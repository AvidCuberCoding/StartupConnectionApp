## Topics Discussed

This week, we started getting our enviornment set up to begin coding. We decided what we wanted each person to work on with Julian working on search results, Haden working on proposals, Chris on chat, James on pitch creation, and Robert on search functionality.
We also discussed what we would use for all of our software and made sure everyone could use the software we need.

## Things Clarified

We made sure that Haden could use .NET since he is on Mac and discussed having limited meetings this week because of conflicting and busy schedules. We also determined who would be working on what in the project.
