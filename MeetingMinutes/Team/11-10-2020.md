## Things Clarified

First, Chris brought focus to details involving the App.vue file, afterwards he bought up a desire to implement a SCRUM meeting structure for future meetings. 
With this structure, we can talk about mischellaneous things after the daily standup of what we've done. 
Chris will have it ready for next meeting on Thursday at 5pm. 
We discussed attempting to schedule a mentor meeting on Saturday at 12pm, which would give us one day to turn in the required documents related to that meeting. 
The team talked about what each individual has completed, especially in reference to Jim.
Jim shared his screen to bring focus to four lines of code that had to be changed, something Chris brought up earlier in the meeting.
