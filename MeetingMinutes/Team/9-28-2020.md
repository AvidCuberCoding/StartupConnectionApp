## Topics Discussed

The primary goal of this meeting was to discuss business requirements. We started with a few general ideas of what the apps busniess objectives would be.  
These general ideas are how we created a starting point for our business objectives. We ended up creating a set of 6 business requirements,  
which can be found [here](../../Design/BusinessRequirements.md).

After the business requirements were set, the team appointed days/times open for team meetings. This allows us to create meeting times without  
needing to always ask for availability. Instead we can state the day we want to meet allowing for quicker meeting scheduling.

## Things Clarified

The team decided to continue with the design assignments to assure we get them done in time. Next week the primary goal will be to get through  
use cases and requirements. Finishing these two task will allow for the team to move to: domain model, tech-stack, and protoyping in a timely manner.
