## Topics Discussed
We discussed our plans for the next iteration which included new team dynamics. Haden, one of our team members, switched majors and as such will no longer be part of our group, which unexpectedly leaves us a member short.
We talked about how each of us will have to take on slightly more work due to this loss. Chris helped me (Julian) find and download the necessary software for the API, Postgre. 
I will use the documentation to connect the API to make sure it's clear enough to understand. Chris will be transitioning from working on the messaging part of the project to working on the pitch with Jim. 
They scheduled a meeting to hammer out the details.

## Things Clarified
We all gained a better understanding of the requirements for the next iteration, especially in light of the team changes. 
Two team members will be focusing their attention on the pitch part of the project. 
We want to finish this iteration off strong, and we all agree that we want to make sure we hit all the boxes for what is required of us to have completed.
