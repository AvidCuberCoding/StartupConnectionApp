## Topics Dicussed

Unfortunately, Chris couldn't attend this meeting because he had food poisoning.
Jim began the meeting by sharing his screen and showing Evan what we had. He clarified that none of the pages look different, everything is visually the same, and we connect to the database without issues. We can create a pitch as well. We had many issues with user authentication, and with Jim the issue was with an old database.
Everything runs fine in the console and we recently fixed a 400 error when trying to create a pitch. The login is handled by okta, but its extremely easy to register.
Evan asked us how confident we are that everything will be done, and we responded confidently. Evan thinks we're in a good spot right now.

## Things Clarified

Updating Jims database fixed the old database issue. We can create messages but not send them quite yet, since messaging was set aside this iteration to focus on pitches. 
We have some errors, currently, but we are discussing how to fix these errors.
