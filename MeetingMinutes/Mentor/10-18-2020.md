## Topics Dicussed

In this meeting the team talked to our mentor Evan about our progress so far seeking his advice on any potential improvements we could make. We discussed our Business Requirements, Use Cases, Requirements, TechStack, Jira: First Iteration Features, Prototype, and Slim templates.

## Things Clarified

Evan said it was good we had so much planned because it'll be very beneficial later on when creating user stories as well as letting us know that we have plenty of use cases and user stories defined. He also said that the Domain model looks good although domain models can get very weavy. We have a good idea of what's going on. For the TechStack, Evan highly recommends Angular (and the Angular tutorial) but not AngularJS. It's a better experience, has more documentation, and way more friendly than AngularJS. Angular works with TypeScript so if we're familiar with java we'll hava a breeze. TypeScript is very similar to JS.
Jira: First Iteration Features - Evan suggests we switch to a user story format for issues. Suggests doing backlog refinement so that a backlog is ready when we reach it. We should try to get the sprint as close to being usable as possible sometime before we actually accept the sprint. If we're doing front-end work, we should try/attach screenshots of our UI/UX.
Do we have a plan for communicating padding, etc. on front end stories? Solution: Slim templates. He'd rather we focus on business logic.
We have a clear vision of the project and we're comfortable bringing stuff to our client.
