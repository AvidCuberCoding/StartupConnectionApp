## Topics Dicussed

In this meeting, we discussed our shortcomings with iteration 1 with no functioning features present, however we had almost a full API built. Evan ran through a retro with us to give us some perspective on what we did right and wrong. We also did a fist of five where we rated our work and our opinion on how well we will do this iteration. We all rated it about a 3.5 - 4. 

## Things Clarified

We figured out some key things we could do for making next iteration and all future ones better. We first discussed open meetings where we hop in a call and help each other out whenever we can on top of our formal meetings. We also decided to double down on some of our tasks instead of everyone getting a full vertical slice. The meeting was helpful in gaining some insight on what we need and what we have to have done. We are hopeful for iteration two as we continue to work on our iteration one tasks and getting the full stack behind them.
