## Topics Dicussed

This week, Evan had missed our initial meeting time so we had to reschedule and didn't have a time where the whole team could be there. Julian and I both talked with Evan and 
discussed our current progress on the project. We told him about the search functionality and our testing on the back and front end. We discussed Vue's strange testing environment
with the need to mock all components necessary for basic running. We finally discussed what we plan to have done for the end of this iteration on monday. 

## Things Clarified

Evan suggested that we don't go for 100% code coverage in our tests because it can cause brittle tests and much of our software is basic Vue, meaning testing it would be redudant. 
We also confirmed our goals for this iteration and started to talk about next iteration. We also planned to talk to the group about getting with Evan and doing a a Resume review to
get us prepared for the workforce.
