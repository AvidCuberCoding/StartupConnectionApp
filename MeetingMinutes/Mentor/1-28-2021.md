## Topics Dicussed

In this meeting, we caught Evan up on everything since he was on vacation for last iteration and didn't know of anything that happened since then. 
We told him about our goals to get pitch pages fully functioning and that we were all going to be working on a single aspect instead of splitting the work between us.
We also informed him of Haden leaving our group, leaving us one team member down. He told us to keep working and remember to play to our strengths and peer program as much as possible.
Overall the meeting was pretty short and to the point since it was recapping everything with Evan and explaining everything we discussed with Ergin yesterday.


## Things Clarified

The things we clarified for this iteration were just ensuring that we were peer programming and we are all working on the pitches instead of splitting the work.
We also clarified that we are very confident in the this iteration, expecting to get the feature fully functioning and make sure that our client is happy with the work we did with minimal loss in grade.
