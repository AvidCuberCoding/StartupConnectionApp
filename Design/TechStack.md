#Tech Stack

###Front-End Development: Angular JS
*We chose Angular due to most of us not having experience with any front-end development framework and Chris had some experience with the framework.

###Back-End Development: Microsoft .NET
*This was chosen by Trey’s request. Since he works primarily in .Net he would like us to create the app’s business logic using it.

###Database Management: PostgreSQL
*PostgreSQL was chosen as our database management system because the group hasn’t used much SQL aside from MySQL, which Trey suggested not to use. PostgreSQL also seems to be the safest option available.

###Version control: GitLab
*This was chosen at Trey’s request. He doesn’t want us to use GitHub due to limited project availability and suggested GitLab since it is a better, free service for private projects.
